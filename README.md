MINESWEEPER!

Introduction
Minesweeper is a single-player strategic puzzle game played usually on a square board. My version is played on a 10x10 grid. The objective of the game is to locate and flag the randomly generated mines throughout the board. Opening safe tiles that does not contain bomb will give clues on which tiles you want to open. Try it for yourself!

Improvements
For the future, I would have liked to implement a point system based on how long the player took to finish the game.
Also, some extra styling would add to the experience in enjoying the game as well as a short how-to-play guide in the game page itself.
